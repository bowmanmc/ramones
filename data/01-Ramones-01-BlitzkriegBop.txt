Hey ho, lets go
Hey ho, lets go
Hey ho, lets go
Hey ho, lets go

Theyre forming in a straight line
Theyre going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop

Theyre piling in the back seat
Theyre generating steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop

Hey ho, lets go
Shoot em in the back now
What they want, I dont know
Theyre all revved up and ready to go

Theyre forming in a straight line
Theyre going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop

Theyre piling in the back seat
Theyre generating steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop

Hey ho, lets go
Shoot em in the back now
What they want, I dont know
Theyre all revved up and ready to go

Theyre forming in a straight line
Theyre going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop

Theyre piling in the back seat
Theyre generating steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop

Hey ho, lets go
Hey ho, lets go
Hey ho, lets go
Hey ho, lets go
