                By February of 1976, when the album was recorded, the Ramones
                had been playing together for almost two years. They recorded
                the songs in the same order they played them live to help
                capture the feel of their concerts.

                        <p>
                            Johnny has song writing credits on three tracks,
                            "I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement",
                            "Loudmouth", and "Havana Affair". The song
                            "Havana Affair" was inspired by
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Proh%C3%ADas">Antonio Proh√≠as</a>,
                            a Cuban immigrant who created the
                            Spy vs Spy comic strip
                            for Mad Magazine.

                            Tommy contributed to two songs on the album, which
                            also happened to be the two singles for the record,
                            "Blitzkrieg Bop" and
                            "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend".
                            "Blitzkrieg Bop" was inspired by the Bay City Rollers
                            song "Saturday Night". They wanted to have a song
                            the audience could chant along with.

                            Joey contributed to three songs on the album,
                            "Beat on the Brat",

                            "Chain Saw". At almost 180 beats per minute,
                            "Chain Saw" is the fastest song on the album and was
                            written after viewing the 1974 horror classic,
