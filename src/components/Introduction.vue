                Recorded over seven days in January of 1976, the debut record
                from the Ramones is one of the most influential records in
                rock & roll history.

                At just over twenty nine minutes long, fourteen of the
                bands most recognizable songs are jam-packed, seven songs a side,
                onto an album ranked at number thirty three on
                <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/">Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>
                list.

                Playing against the high-minded
                lyrics and musical virtuosity common for rock bands of the era,
                The Ramones played loud, fast, simple songs with buzzsaw guitars
                and outrageous lyrics.

                Even though the album sold poorly at first
                (only 6,000 copies in the first year), it helped kickstart
                the fledgling punk scene in the United States and has
                influenced countless bands in the forty years since it was released.

                For me, this album is the soundtrack of my teenage years &mdash;
                carefree days in the late 90's spent listening to punk rock and
                acting stupid with my friends. I've compiled information here
                about the production of the album and hope you'll give it a
                spin while learning
                more about this important gem in rock and roll history.
